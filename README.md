# Predictive-Analysis-for-Manufacturing-Operations
Project Overview
This project implements a RESTful API using Flask to predict machine downtime based on manufacturing data. It uses a logistic regression model trained on data containing information like process temperature and tool wear to predict whether a machine will experience downtime.

#The API provides endpoints for:
Uploading a dataset.
Training the model.
Making predictions based on input features.

#Features
Upload Dataset: Upload a CSV file containing manufacturing data for training.
Train Model: Train the logistic regression model using the uploaded dataset.
Predict Downtime: Use the trained model to predict whether downtime will occur based on input features.

#Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Framework: Flask
Machine Learning Library: scikit-learn
API Testing Tool: Postman
